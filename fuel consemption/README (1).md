Model

4WD/4X4 = Four-wheel drive
AWD = All-wheel drive
CNG = Compressed natural gas
FFV = Flexible-fuel vehicle
NGV = Natural gas vehicle
# = High output engine that provides more power than the standard engine of the same size
Transmission

A = Automatic
AM = Automated manual
AS = Automatic with select shift
AV = Continuously variable
M = Manual
3 - 10 = Number of gears
Fuel Type
X = Regular gasoline
Z = Premium gasoline
D = Diesel
E = Ethanol (E85)
N = Natural Gas
Fuel Consumption
City and highway fuel consumption ratings are shown in litres per 100 kilometres (L/100 km) - combined rating (55% city, 45% hwy) is shown in L/100 km and in miles per imperial gallon (mpg)
CO2 Emissions (g/km),Estimated tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions (in grams per kilometre) are based on fuel type and the combined fuel consumption rating.
